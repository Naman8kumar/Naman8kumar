Hi, I’m @Naman8kumar
Passionate about technology and its impact on business and humanity. Optimism, gratitude, curiosity, and determination drive my life.

I have a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, and enjoy solving problems that blend logic and creativity.

Currently growing in web development through real-world, hands-on learning. I'm actively working on two major projects:

An AI-powered Lung Cancer Risk Assessment web app

A Mental Health support platform with features like mood tracking, journaling, and AI-based suggestions

As part of my open-source journey, I’ve contributed 24+ PRs across major OWASP projects, and submitted two GSoC 2025 proposals — focused on security automation and API governance using Spectral.

This journey has taught me consistency, collaboration, and the true spirit of the open-source community.

I’m always open to learning, connecting, and building something meaningful together.
